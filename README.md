# iwantmccbot
Because talking to people is social interaction, and I don't like it.

**NOTE:** This project was created as a joke. Please don't think that this is a good bit of programming, it is not.

## Setup and Installation

If, for some ungodly reason, you want to deploy this bot:

* You MUST have NPM and Node.js installed for it to work. If you're not sure how, the internet wll help.
* This project takes ~50mb of storage, so please don't have a 100% full disk.
* You need to create a discord bot, do that over at the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/me)

1) Download the zip file of this repo, and unzip it. 

2) Navigate into the zip file with your command prompt of choice.

3) Run `npm i` in the directory, and wait. Your computer may require you to re-run it as sudo or an administrator. 

4) Once the dependancies are installed, create a copy of `.env.example` and replace the sample token with your Discord Bot's actual token. 

5) Run the index.js file as you please, I recommend using [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), as it makes life easy. 

6) Profit. I think. Beats me.
